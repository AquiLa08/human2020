<p style="text-align: justify;">In this stage, smash the wall and grab the extinguisher. Now use it to break the glass and get out. Now move through the debris and use the wrecking ball for going to the other side. Use the same ball to break the wall on the right side of the crane.
Now jump there and use the lever to make a platform. Then break the glass to switch open the next-door prior to pulling the beams from underneath the platform until it becomes a ramp.
Keep the door open using one of the beams and move to the next room. Get to the top and open the door. Next, use a boulder to smash the wall and do the puzzles until you are in the glass floor room.
Now use the red plank on the forklift to get to the top of the platform. Then drop the yellow beam to break the glass. Now open the door by flipping the lever to get to the next level.
