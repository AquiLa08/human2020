<p style="text-align: justify;">The first level of the game will be a tutorial which will tell you about how to play the game. Clear the tutorial as it will not be that difficult to find yourself in a derelict train station. Move the obstacles out of the way and jump between the train cars to head through the door. This door will take you to the next level of the game.</p>
