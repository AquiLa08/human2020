<p style="text-align: justify;">Here in the new level, you will need to put boxes on the switches to ensure that the doors stay open. Get past the first elevator and move the train car to the right side in the second room to bring the box up by using the elevator. Place the box on the train and move it to the left to open the door. Now walk through it to enter the Canyon level.</p>
