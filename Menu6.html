<p style="text-align: justify;">Use the plank to wedge the broken lock in the bars and then use the catapult to break down the castle walls. Now move inside and push the cart with the stone block to the stairs.
Climb up and hop on to take the stone with you. Get to the top of the roof and then use the lanterns to get to the other side. Open the door and drag the cart to the planks.
Now move to the segment with the hook and use it to get to the other side. Use the same hook to pull down the plank which will create a ramp. Now go to the top and climb the wall. Now move across the bridge before you swing using a lantern. Now use the windmill to go to the next island. Then go to the top and uncover the hole.
When you fall down the hole, climb up the rocks and push the boulder down to knock a ledge for you to climb up. The platform on to the next area and catapult yourself to the bridge. Then hang onto the bridge so it drags down before you use the catapult to shoot yourself through the small hole in the gate.
