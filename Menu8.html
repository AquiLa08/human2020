<p style="text-align: justify;">Plug the cords from the first room in their sockets in the second room. Then plug the battery cords in the third room. Now unplug the battery and take it to the fourth room. Push it onto the switch to open the door. Now climb up the wall and jump on the platform. Now use the box to open the door . In the next room, use the forklift to raise the door. Climb over the wall to skip a large part of the game. Then drive the truck to the second Power Plantâ€™s back lot. Use the torch found near the thriller pillars to light the three tanks which have the coal.
You are almost done now, go back to the coal line and fill the dump truck with coal. Take it back to the three tanks and fill them up until they overload.
This will power up the fans inside of the pillars which will blast you to the top of the pillars. Now jump across the pillars until you get to the final one. Move inside this pillar to end the game for good.
