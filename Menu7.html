<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Get to the speedboat on the island and then go to the top of the mountain. Use the lever to lift it up and attach the chain which is attached to the dam to the lift.
Now press the lever again so the dam will break apart and you can use the raft to get down the mountain. Activate the windmill and then get inside the speedboat to go to the last level.
